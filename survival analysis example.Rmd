This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r survival analysis example}





library(survival) # this is the cornerstone command for survival analysis in R
library(ggplot2) # newer package that does nice plots

survival_analysis = data.frame(survival_analysis)
gender <- factor(survival_analysis[,"gender"]) # R calls categorical variables factors
fu_time <- survival_analysis[,"fu_time"] # continuous variable (numeric) 
death <- survival_analysis[,"death"] # binary variable (numeric) 


# Plotting a KM-Plot
km_fit <- survfit(Surv(fu_time, death) ~ 1)

plot(km_fit)

summary(km_fit, times = c(1:7,30,60,90*(1:10))) 




#To compare survival by gender, we can run a logrank test. There are many ways to do this because of different versions for different scenarios, e.g. particular types of censored data, but weâ€™ll just give the standard one:


survdiff(formula = Surv(fu_time, death) ~ gender, rho = 0) 


```


```{r survival time by age}
#To compare the survival times for patients 65 and over with those under 65

age_65plus <- ifelse(survival_analysis[,"age"]>=65,1,0) # dichotomise age
table(age_65plus, exclude = NULL) # inspect the numbers - always a good idea

survdiff(Surv(fu_time, death) ~ age_65plus, rho=0)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
